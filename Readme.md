# About
It's just a simple OOP program, created to implement Iterator and Visitor patterns.
## how it works
First program create tree graph - it read list of nodes where if in list[0]=2 means that root node connected to node 1 and node 2 and etc.
Then program create each node randomly as different type nodes (to use visitor pattern)
